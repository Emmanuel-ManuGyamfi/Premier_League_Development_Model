# Premier League Development Model ⚽️📊  
*A data-driven analysis of winger performance, archetypes, and predictive modeling across the Premier League.*

---

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project builds an **end-to-end data science pipeline** for evaluating and forecasting player development in the Premier League.  
Focusing on **wingers**, it combines performance data from multiple seasons to uncover player **archetypes**, **track progression**, and **predict next-season attacking output** (`xG+xA per 90`).

By integrating feature engineering, clustering (PCA + K-Means), and regression modeling, the **Premier League Development Model** aims to bridge **quantitative analysis** and **football insight** — providing interpretable, evidence-based perspectives for scouting and player development.

### 🔧 Built With
- **Python** — pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly  
- **Machine Learning** — PCA, K-Means, Linear Regression  
- **Visualization** — radar charts, PCA maps, trend timelines  
- **Football Data** — per-90 stats, team strength proxies, multi-season lags

### 🧠 Analytical Goals
1. Identify key winger archetypes across three Premier League seasons.  
2. Quantify player progression using per-90 and lagged performance metrics.  
3. Predict each player’s next-season attacking efficiency (`xG+xA per 90`).  
4. Visualize complex performance profiles in interpretable footballing terms.
